<title>Part-of-Speech Tagger</title>
	<section id="tools.postagger.tagging">
		<title>Tagging</title>
		<para>
		The Part of Speech Tagger marks tokens with their corresponding word type
		based on the token itself and the context of the token. A token might have
		multiple pos tags depending on the token and the context. The OpenNLP POS Tagger
		uses a probability model to predict the correct pos tag out of the tag set.
		To limit the possible tags for a token a tag dictionary can be used which increases
		the tagging and runtime performance of the tagger.
		</para>
			<section id="tools.postagger.tagging.cmdline">
		<title>POS Tagger Tool</title>
		<para>
		The easiest way to try out the POS Tagger is the command line tool. The tool is
		only intended for demonstration and testing.
		Download the english maxent pos model and start the POS Tagger Tool with this command:
		<screen>
			<![CDATA[
$ bin/opennlp POSTagger en-pos-maxent.bin]]>
		 </screen>
		The POS Tagger now reads a tokenized sentence per line from stdin.
		Copy these two sentences to the console:
		<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
Pierre Vinken , 61 years old , will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29 .
Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V. , the Dutch publishing group .]]>
		 </programlisting>
		 the POS Tagger will now echo the sentences with pos tags to the console:
		<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[

Mr._NNP Vinken_NNP is_VBZ chairman_NN of_IN Elsevier_NNP N.V._NNP ,_, the_DT Dutch_NNP publishing_VBG group_NN]]>
		 </programlisting> 
		 The tag set used by the english pos model is the Penn Treebank tag set.
		 See the link below for a description of the tags.
		</para>
      </section>
      
		<section id="tools.postagger.tagging.api">
		<title>POS Tagger API</title>
		<para>
		    The POS Tagger can be embedded into an application via its API.
			First the pos model must be loaded into memory from disk or an other source.
			In the sample below its loaded from disk.
			<programlisting language="java">
				<![CDATA[
InputStream modelIn = null;

try {
  modelIn = new FileInputStream("en-pos-maxent.bin");
  POSModel model = new POSModel(modelIn);
}
catch (IOException e) {
  // Model loading failed, handle the error
  e.printStackTrace();
}
finally {
  if (modelIn != null) {
    try {
      modelIn.close();
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
    }
  }
}]]>
			</programlisting>
			After the model is loaded the POSTaggerME can be instantiated.
			<programlisting language="java">
				<![CDATA[
POSTaggerME tagger = new POSTaggerME(model);]]>
			</programlisting>
			The POS Tagger instance is now ready to tag data. It expects a tokenized sentence
			as input, which is represented as a String array, each String object in the array
			is one token.
	   </para>
	   <para>
	   The following code shows how to determine the most likely pos tag sequence for a sentence.
	   	<programlisting language="java">
		  <![CDATA[
String sent[] = new String[]{"Most", "large", "cities", "in", "the", "US", "had",
                             "morning", "and", "afternoon", "newspapers", "."};		  
String tags[] = tagger.tag(sent);]]>
			</programlisting>
			The tags array contains one part-of-speech tag for each token in the input array. The corresponding
			tag can be found at the same index as the token has in the input array.
			The confidence scores for the returned tags can be easily retrieved from
			a POSTaggerME with the following method call:
				   	<programlisting language="java">
		  <![CDATA[
double probs[] = tagger.probs();]]>
			</programlisting>
			The call to probs is stateful and will always return the probabilities of the last
			tagged sentence. The probs method should only be called when the tag method
			was called before, otherwise the behavior is undefined.
			</para>
			<para>
			Some applications need to retrieve the n-best pos tag sequences and not
			only the best sequence.
			The topKSequences method is capable of returning the top sequences.
			It can be called in a similar way as tag.
			<programlisting language="java">
		  <![CDATA[
Sequence topSequences[] = tagger.topKSequences(sent);]]>
			</programlisting>	
			Each Sequence object contains one sequence. The sequence can be retrieved
			via Sequence.getOutcomes() which returns a tags array 
			and Sequence.getProbs() returns the probability array for this sequence.
	  		 </para>
	</section>
	</section>
		<section id="tools.postagger.training">
		<title>Training</title>
		<para>
			The POS Tagger can be trained on annotated training material. The training material
			is a collection of tokenized sentences where each token has the assigned part-of-speech tag.
			The native POS Tagger training material looks like this:
			<programlisting>
		  <![CDATA[
About_IN 10_CD Euro_NNP ,_, I_PRP reckon_VBP ._.
That_DT sounds_VBZ good_JJ ._.]]>
			</programlisting>		
			Each sentence must be in one line. The token/tag pairs are combined with "_".
			The token/tag pairs are whitespace separated. The data format does not
			define a document boundary. If a document boundary should be included in the
			training material it is suggested to use an empty line.
		</para>
		<para>The Part-of-Speech Tagger can either be trained with a command line tool,
		or via an trainng API.
		</para>
		
		<section id="tools.postagger.training.tool">
		<title>Training Tool</title>
		<para>
			OpenNLP has a command line tool which is used to train the models available from the model
			download page on various corpora.
		</para>
		<para>
		 Usage of the tool:
			<screen>
				<![CDATA[
$ bin/opennlp POSTaggerTrainer
Usage: opennlp POSTaggerTrainer -lang language -encoding charset [-iterations num] [-cutoff num] \ 
    [-dict tagdict] [-model maxent|perceptron|perceptron_sequence] -data trainingData -model model
-lang language     specifies the language which is being processed.
-encoding charset  specifies the encoding which should be used for reading and writing text.
-iterations num    specified the number of training iterations
-cutoff num        specifies the min number of times a feature must be seen]]>

		<para>
		The following command illustrates how an english part-of-speech model can be trained:
		<screen>
		  <![CDATA[

		<section id="tools.postagger.training.api">
		<title>Training API</title>
		<para>
		The Part-of-Speech Tagger training API supports the programmatically training of a new pos model.
		Basically three steps are necessary to train it:
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>The application must open a sample data stream</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Call the POSTagger.train method</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Save the POSModel to a file or database</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		The following code illustrates that:
		<programlisting language="java">
				<![CDATA[
POSModel model = null;

InputStream dataIn = null;
try {
  dataIn = new FileInputStream("en-pos.train");
  ObjectStream<String> lineStream =
		new PlainTextByLineStream(dataIn, "UTF-8");
  ObjectStream<POSSample> sampleStream = new WordTagSampleStream(lineStream);

  model = POSTaggerME.train("en", sampleStream, ModelType.MAXENT,
      null, null, 100, 5);
}
catch (IOException e) {
  // Failed to read or parse training data, training failed
  e.printStackTrace();
}
finally {
  if (dataIn != null) {
    try {
      dataIn.close();
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
      // Not an issue, training already finished.
      // The exception should be logged and investigated
      // if part of a production system.
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}]]>
	</programlisting>
	The above code performs the first two steps, opening the data and training
	the model. The trained model must still be saved into an OutputStream, in
	the sample below it is written into a file.
	<programlisting language="java">
				<![CDATA[
OutputStream modelOut = null;
try {
  modelOut = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(modelFile));
  model.serialize(modelOut);
}
catch (IOException e) {
  // Failed to save model
  e.printStackTrace();
}
finally {
  if (modelOut != null) {
  try {
     modelOut.close();
  }
  catch (IOException e) {
    // Failed to correctly save model.
    // Written model might be invalid.
    e.printStackTrace();
  }
}]]>
		</programlisting>
		</para>
		</section>
		<section id="tools.postagger.training.tagdict">
		<title>Tag Dictionary</title>
		<para>
		The tag dicitionary is a word dictionary which specifies which tags a specific token can have. Using a tag
		dictionary has two advantages, unappropriate tags can not been assigned to tokens in the dictionary and the
		beam search algrotihm has to consider less possibilties and can search faster.
		</para>
		<para>
		The dictionary is defined in a xml format and can be created and stored with the POSDictionary class.
		Pleaes for now checkout the javadoc and source code of that class.
		</para>
		<para>Note: The format should be documented and sample code should show how to use the dictionary.

		<section id="tools.postagger.eval.tool">
		<title>Evaluation Tool</title>
		<para>
		There is a command line tool to evaluate a given model on a test data set.
		The command line tool currently does not support the cross validation
		evaluation (contribution welcome).
		The following command shows how the tool can be run:
		<screen>
				<![CDATA[
$bin/opennlp POSTaggerEvaluator -encoding utf-8 -model pt.postagger.model -data pt.postagger.test]]>

RPM INSTRUCTIONS

The easiest thing to do is to install the binary rpm. But this
only works if the binary rpm was built for a system similar to
yours. Second easiest thing is to rebuild a binary rpm from
the source rpm. If all fails, you can try building rpms from
the source.

1)  How to install a binary RPM:
        rpm -Uvh packagename.rpm
    
2)  How to rebuild the source RPM:
        rpm --rebuild packagename.src.rpm
    Then you simply install the binary RPM as in 1) above

3)  How to build source and binary rpms from the source.
    Using the distutils: 
        python setup.py  bdist --formats=rpm
    If all works fine, a tar.gz, a src.rpm and a binary.rpm
    will be written in the subdirectory "./dist"
    Finally, you install the binary RPM as in 1) above.
    
    Note: you may need to customize the file "setup.cfg",
    specifically the "requires" tag.
    
    Note 2: See also the distutils documentation,
    http://www.python.org/doc/current/dist/dist.html

PyGSL documentation
-------------------

This directory contains the LaTeX sources of the PyGSL
documentation. The documentation can be built in different formats:
HTML, PDF and PostScript.

In order to build the documentation, you will need a LaTeX
distribution (e.g. TeTeX), and LaTeX2HTML.

Several tools, which are part of the Python sources, are needed to
build the documentation. Therefore, you also need to have the Python
sources. The mklinks script can be used to create symbolic links to
these tools. It is called with the path of the Python's sources Doc
directory, e.g.:

   ./mklinks ~/Python-2.4.1/Doc
      
Once the symbolics links are created, the Makefile can be used to
build the documentation. By default, it will build the documentation
in HTML format.

To build the documentation is PDF format, type:

   make pdf

The default paper format is A4. If you want to build a PDF in US
letter format instead, type:

   make PAPER=letter pdf

To build a A4 PostScript, type:

   make ps

or, for a US letter PostScript:

   make PAPER=letter ps

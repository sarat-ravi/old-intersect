               PyGSL: Python interface for GNU Scientific Library

Status of GSL-Library:

   The gsl-library is since version 1.0 stable and for general use. Read more
   about it at the [1]GSL homepage.

Status of this interface:

   We are collecting implementations of parts of gsl. So the interface is not
   complete. We are looking forward to contributions of new submodules, while
   maintaining the awailabel code.

Requirements:

   To build the interface, you will need

     * [2]gsl-1.2 or better,
     * [3]python2.2 or better and
     * [4]NumPy, and
     * a ANSI C compiler (i.e. gcc).

Retrieving the Interface:

   You can download pygsl at [5]http://pygsl.sourceforge.net

Installing GSL interface:

   Uninstall the old version of pygsl

   gsl-config must be on your path

   gzip -d -c pygsl-x.y.z.tar.gz|tar xvf-
   cd pygsl-x.y.z
   #do this with your prefered python version
   #to set the gsl location explicitly use setup.py --gsl-prefix=/path/to/gsl
   #If your are using cvs, remove your build directory.
   python setup.py build
   # Running only
   python setup.py
   # can result in an error. So if you see an error runing setup.py please
   run python setup.py build
   # change to a id, that is allowed to do installation
   python setup.py install

   Ready....

Using pygsl

   Do NOT test the interface in the distribution root directory! -- please
   install it first and then change to the tests directory and execute python
   run_test.py If you want to execute it in the distribution root directory,
   please run python setup.py build_ext -i first! It will put the requried
   binary files into the pygsl directory.

   Just write in python
   import pygsl.sf
   print "%g+/-%g"%pygsl.sf.erf(1)

   or
   import pygsl.rng
   rng=pygsl.rng.rng()
   print rng.gaussian(1.0)

   You may set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to find the gsl
   shared object.

Uninstall GSL interface:

   rm -r "python install path"/lib/python"version"/site-packages/pygsl

Supported Platforms:

     * Linux with python2.* and gsl-1.x
     * Mac OS X with python2.* and gsl-1.x
     * Win32 with python2.* and gsl-1.x

   but is supposed to compile and run on any posix platform

Testing:

   The directory test will contain several testsuites, based on python
   unittest. Change to this directory to run the tests.

What is implemented (versus gsl1.10):

        * Blas
        * Chebyshev
        * Combination
        * Const
        * Diff
        * Eigen
        * Fit
        * Ieee
        * Integrate
        * Interpolation
        * Linalg
        * Math
        * Minimize
        * Multifit
        * Multifit_nlin
        * Multimin
        * Multiroots
        * Odeiv
        * Permutation
        * Poly
        * Qrng
        * Rng
        * Roots
        * Siman
        * Sf
        * Spline
        * Statistics

What is not implemented yet (versus gsl1.10):

     * GSL Capabilites not yet wrapped by PyGSL

          * Sorting
          * N-tuples

     * GSL Capabilites partly implemented

          * Discrete Hankel Transforms

   See also the [6]TODO file in the distribution.

   For the exact function volume for a module, please type:

   import pygsl.sf
   dir(pygsl.sf)

   You can do this with the other modules, too. The naming scheme is the same
   as in gsl.

Documentation:

   There will be a small reference, but the function reference can be found
   in the doc strings and at the gsl-reference. See also the "examples"
   directory.

Support:

   Please send mails to [7]the pygsl mailinglist.

Developement:

   You can browse our [8]cvs tree.

   Type this to check out the actual version:
   cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.pygsl.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pygsl login
   Hit return for no password.
   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.pygsl.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pygsl co
   pygsl

   The script tools/extract_tool.py generates most of the special function
   code.

ToDo:

   See TODO.
